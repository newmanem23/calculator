# Calculator
This is my calculator project for The Odin Project Foundations Curriculum. 

The purpose of this project was to:
- Build a logical calculator app using JavaScript
- Combine all the skills learned in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into one app

I enjoyed working through all the edge cases in this one. It made me appreciate
how much work went into developing even the simplest of calculators back in the 
day.
